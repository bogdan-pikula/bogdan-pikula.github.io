Hi, I'm *Bogdan Pikula*, a PhD student in Computer Science at the **University of Toronto**, working under **[Dr. Daniel Wigdor](https://danielwigdor.com/)**. My research focuses on Large Language Models, Human-AI interaction, and Generative UI, with a particular interest in making AI systems more intuitive and accessible to users.

My journey bridges technical innovation with human-centered design. At the **Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP)(https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/)** lab, I work on deploying and fine-tuning state-of-the-art AI models, scaling them to handle real-time, interactive tasks. Previously at **Ubisoft Toronto**, I developed tools for creating expressive facial animations, working at the intersection of computer graphics and emotional computing.

Beyond research, I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring. As a Teaching Assistant, I work with interdisciplinary students from computer science, social science, art, and music students, helping them bring their creative visions to life through technology in a variety of courses.

When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me exploring nature, making coffee, biking or all of those at once.
